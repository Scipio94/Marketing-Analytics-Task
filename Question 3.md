# Question 3

The chart in sheet 4 shows the trend in revenue (sample data) year over year at the foundation. Q2 revenue appears to be lower in the current year compared to previous years. Describe the lines of analyses/questioning you would follow to diagnose why there might be a dip. (For instance, you may ask, is any specific marketing channel seeing a decline over others and why?) Make assumptions where  necessary, but state all assumptions.

Use tab titled – Revenue Trend

### Assumptions

The first thing to note is that overall there is a downtrend in the overall revenue YoY from 2021 to 2023 which indicates that this is a progressive trend. On average there was a 14% or $275 decline in revenue YoY from 2021 to 2023. My next inquiry would be about any events, local, regional, or global, that may have occurred that would’ve led to a steady decline in revenue and is it likely that the decline would continue?
