### Question 1 
The Marketing team at MJFF wants to evaluate if their email audience is more likely to respond to CTAs
that use “emotional” language over those that use “impact-oriented” language (the default that has
always been sent) in their emails. The marketing and communications departments crafted two versions
of their Monthly Appeal series of emails – slated to be sent out the next month. The recipient list was
split equally and at random, and each list received one of the email versions.
Based on the email engagement results, would you recommend that the marketing switch to using more
emotional language in their emails, or should the team continue using impact-oriented language? What
additional information/experiment design changes would you require to make a clear recommendation?

**Use tabs titled – Email V1 Impact Language and Email V2 Emotional Language**

### Question 2 
Audience segments inform key strategic initiatives for several teams across MJFF. Identifying relevant
segments helps the communications team to craft targeted messaging, the email team to set up
journeys, and the marketing team to predict conversions. The marketing team wants to understand if
they can segment their existing database into meaningful and distinct categories, as well as understand
their behavior, to inform specific targeting tactics.
This dataset (sample data) looks at around 50K contacts in the database along with information
collected over time. What segments would you recommend based on the data available?

### Question 3
The chart in sheet 4 shows the trend in revenue (sample data) year over year at the foundation. Q2
revenue appears to be lower in the current year compared to previous years. Describe the lines of
analyses/questioning you would follow to diagnose why there might be a dip. (For instance, you may
ask, is any specific marketing channel seeing a decline over others and why?) Make assumptions where
necessary, but state all assumptions.
